1. We believe our week was alright, considering we had all only just met each other for the first time.
2. The dynamic was good, but we need to improve in terms of communication.
3. With additional time, we would have completed the program as well as add a few small features we had in mind.
4. The GUI is disorganised, split across disparate classes, while the database lacks proper error handling.
5. Members of this group know the following languages:
  - C
  - Java
  - Scala
  - Kotlin
  - Assembler
  - C#
  - Ruby
  - Python
6. Members of this group know of the following data structures:
  - Lists
  - Stacks
  - Linked Lists
  - Doubly-Linked Lists
  - Hash Tables
  - Binary Trees
  - Arrays
  - Vectors
7. Most of the group like to program as it allows them to manipulate what the computer does as well as shape the
"virtual" world. We look forward to learning C++ in particular.
8. Our group is concerned about our communication and thus ability to keep to deadlines.
