1. (reminder on the sheet)
2. Macros are slightly difficult to grasp at first, due to the time they're applied during compilation.
3. Java has no direct equivalent, though something similar can be made using annotations that are processed at build time.
4. Java's arrays are very similar, but C++ arrays are more direct to the hardware.
5. Easy enough to grasp, it's only a region in memory.
6. Vectors are dynamic length, while arrays are fixed length. This makes arrays slightly faster. Where with arrays you use
indexing (e.g. `array[0]`), the vector uses a method call (`vector.at(int)`).
7. When you need the length to be variable.
8. It was tricky, but more because of the problem than the code itself.
9. Most of the code was similar, except one method processed to the top and bottom halves seperately, while another did it
all in a single loop.
10. We're not sure - one divides the work, but the other only uses a single loop.
11. One method was more concise, but other than that they delivered the same results.
12. Not really, no.
13. Object orientation is also explored in the IT Project course
14. I'm not entirely sure, yet. C++ is lower level than the web development of IT Project.
