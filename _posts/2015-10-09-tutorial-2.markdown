1. The lab was alright in terms of difficulty. It wasn't too hard or too easy.
2. There wasn't many significant differences in answers; the only difference between answers appeared when we had to
program the diamond shape, where some programmed it immediately as a diamond while others divided it into two pyramid
shapes.
3. We believe we had enough time to do the lab and therefore wouldn't have changed our answers much.
4. A particular part of the course I'm interested in learning more about is different data structures and their
differences between languages.
5. The only thing that slightly scares me is memory allocation in C later on.
6. The Hello World program is pretty simple across languages; C++ is not much different from C, Java or Python.
7. In C++ we're currently using arrows to direct the stream, but we could use C's `printf()` call. In Java, we use
`println()` generally.
8. Declaring variables is the same as anywhere else and constants aren't any different.
9. I/O is a bit different with cin/cout, where they can accept any kind of input no matter the data type, while other
languages would need a type cast.
10. Looks are delcared and functions work like in C, Java and Python.
11. Nothing in the lectures so far has surprised me.
